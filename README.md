ActiveIgnition
==============

ActiveIgnition is not a framework, it's a combination package of CodeIgniter's simplicity, phpactiverecord's power and comprehensive specification and testing tools, the magnificent pecs.

CodeIgniter 2.0 and phpactiverecord combined based on this [article] (http://matthewmachuga.com/post/871550737/adding-php-activerecord-to-a-codeigniter-app). 

To use phpactiverecord and pecs, you can try to add 'activerecord' and 'pecs' into your $libraries at autoload.php.

Documentation is not complete, but I will try to give you a "Kick In" Tutorial as soon as possible.

Cherio.
